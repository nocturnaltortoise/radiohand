# Radiohand

Radiohand is a Raspberry Pi radio, controlled with a Pimoroni Skywriter gesture sensor.
Very much a work in progress.
Currently it can switch on/switch off and change volume, of one radio station (BBC Radio Five Live).

## Future Plans
- Switching stations with side flicks;
- Maybe code for displaying on an LCD screen;
- Maybe other control options, such as hardware buttons or an app.
